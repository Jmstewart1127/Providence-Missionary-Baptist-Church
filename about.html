                    <p>In 1991 Pastor Mark received his call and was licensed in the ministry.  He was ordained in February 1995 as an Associate minister of Providence Missionary Baptist Church.  He was selected as Pastor in Fall of 2001. Pastor Mark is continuing in the foot steps of his father Pastor Lewis A. McGhee who also served as Pastor of PMBC for forty years, until he received his heavenly call and went home to be with the Lord.</p>
                    <p>Pastor Mark loves his family.  He and his wife celebrated 25 years of marriage this year 2016.      
						He loves working with people. He is a faithful Christian who is trustworthy and loves teaching and sharing God’s Word with all people.</p>
                    <p>He is continuing his goal in education, to receive a Divinity Degree in Theological education.</p>
					<p>Pastor McGhee is very excited about the vision he has for PMBC future. The goal for the church is to strengthen families, reaching out in the community by offering hope. He has lead and developed outreach ministries to feed and cloth those who need assistance. Every year Pastor McGhee provides back to school resources for families.  </p>
					<p>His long term goal is to build a family life school and campus center to educate and strengthen families. And be able to offer a safe place for children to learn and play sports that will create a teamwork environment.</p>
					<p>Pastor McGhee’s wife, Dorice is very supportive and devoted to the ministry and call of Christ.  She lives out the principles taught by God’s Word.  Dorice has received various educational studies and achievements in theology.  She earned an Associate in Biblical Studies and holds a Bachelors of Scriptural Psychology awarded Summa Cum Laude from Heart of America Christian College and Theological Seminary.  Dorice enjoys life.  She is a Christian, wife, mother and friend.  Her passion is to help those who are unable to give in return and lives with a heart to bless others with more.  </p>
					<p>Joshua is following in the footsteps of his parents.  He is growing gracefully in his Christian life.  His simple prayer is for Jesus to keep our hearts right so we all can experience heaven.  Joshua loves to sing, play the piano and swim.</p>
					<p>Together this family is an unstoppable force of action being lead by the power of the Lord.  Just like their church theme:  “For with God nothing shall be impossible.”  They are looking up, reaching out and moving forward.   </p>
					<p><strong>Joshua 24:15, “…but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.”</strong></p>
